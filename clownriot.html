    <P>Say the word "Clown" today and people immediately think of guys in makeup who love brothels but hate Firemen, but where did this reputation come from? The answer to that is most likely the Toronto clown riots of 1855. Troubles began when the clowns of a visiting circus troupe dropped into a Toronto brothel where a group of volunteer Firefighters were already hanging about. It wasn't long before a brawl broke out and as expected the hard as nails clowns won out. </P>

    <div id="box2" class="box">
    <p>This particular group of Firefighters wouldn't take this lying down though. Already the story was doing the rounds about the time they had arrived at a fire and found another group of volunteers fighting it. A fight broke out between the groups about who would get to fight the fire. Police arrived to break things up but the two groups of Firemen teamed up to bash the Police.
    </p>
    <P>The building burned down while this was happening.</P>
    </div>
    <div id="box3" class="box">
    <p>And so the night after the brothel fight an angry mob from Toronto attacked the circus with the Firefighters on hand to serve up revenge. One story even said that a Fireman had been about to kill a clown with an axe but was stopped by the Mayor of Toronto. Police were on hand but did nothing to stop the violence because they were part of the same union as the firefighters and no one likes a clown. After this no one could deny that this was no longer the Toronto clown brothel fight but the "Great Toronto Clown Riots"</p>

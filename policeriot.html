        <h1 id="policetitle">New York Police Riots</h1>
        <div class="container" id="policestory">
            <div id="box1" class="box"><p>The New York Police riots of 1857 started with allegations of massive corruption within the New York Municipal police force. In response legislation was passed and a new police force, the New York Metropolitan Police force was formed. And with two police forces everything turned to shit.</p></div>
            <div id="box2" class="box"><p>One of the first actions of the new poilce force was to send an officer into City Hall to arrest the corrupt Mayor. The mayor told the officer to Fuck Off so he did, but returned with a lot more of the newly formed Metropolitan police in support. But City Hall was full of the old Municipal Police so they came out and the old police force bashed the shit out of the new police force on the steps of city hall. </p></div>
            <div id="box3" class="box"><p>The Mayor was eventually arrested but released shortly after. The Metropolitan police took over but the Municipal police lingered around fighting the new police force and interfering with arrests. New York criminals realized that the police were more interested in fighting each other than actually policing and a crime wave began. This crime wave led to a gang war between "The Bowery Boys"(who were firefighters) and "The Dead Rabbits" which came to be known as "The Dead Rabbits Riot".</p></div>

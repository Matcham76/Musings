                <p>Tardigrades are considered to be the toughest animals on Earth. This toughness has allowed them to survice on Earth for over 600 million years. To give you a better idea of what that actually means lets convert years to seconds and look at some ages.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="box2" class="box">
                <p>600 Million seconds is just over 19 years. Modern humans evolved in Africa 200,000 years ago, so to a 19 year old Tardigrade we evolved just under 2 days and 8 hours ago. We started settlements and stopped wandering around eating bugs about 3 hours and 20 minutes ago, the Pyramids were built an hour and a quater ago and we've had electricity for about 2 and a half minutes </p>
            </div>
            <div id="box3" class="box">
            <p>Tardigrades have survived all 5 mass extinction events. The most successful evolutionary period so far was the Jurrasic age that saw the evolution of all the most famous dinosaurs right up to their extinction. For a 19 year old Tardigarde that would have been from roughly their 13th birthday to under a year and a half later. Many scientists believe that Tardigrades are tough enough that they will stay alive on Earth until the Sun burns out in 5 Billion years and even then they will probably hold out a while. At 19 Tardigrades are probably babies on their way to being over 160 years old.  </p>
